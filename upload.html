<h3 class="grayfont">Submitting Images for Print</h3>
<p class="grayfont">You can drop image files off at the studio anytime we are  open.<br>
  If you prefer, you can email image files under 5 MB as attachments to brian@theartfulimage.com
  <br>
  If you want to submit a large image or several images and can't drop
them off, you can upload them to the Artful Image public FTP server:<br>
  ftp://theartfuliamge.com. You will need to email for a username and password to access the server.</p>
<h3 class="grayfont">Image file formats and recomendations</h3>
<p class="grayfont">Acceptable file types: JPEG, TIFF, PSD, PDF. <br>
Almost any color space will be excepted, but ProPhotoRGB,  AdobeRGB, and sRGB are preferred.<br>
Please flatten any layers before submitting<br>
Optimum resolution for files is 360 ppi, but we can work  with whatever you have. For high quality prints, we recomend<br>
a resolution of at least 240 ppi at the size you want to print.</p>
<p class="grayfont">State whether you want borders or borderless printing<br>
  For borderless printing, expect to lose approximately 3 mm  (1/8 inch) from each edge.  <br>
For bordered prints, please state the size of the borders  you require<br>
The default is 1/4 inch borders unless otherwise specified by you.<br>
Borders are internal to the print. An 8 by 12 inch print, for example, will be
7 1/2 by 11 1/2 inches on 8 x 12 inch paper.<br>
</p>
<h3 class="grayfont">Instructions for uploading images from a computer running Windows</h3>
<p class="grayfont">On a Windows machine you can upload images by copying and pasting or draging and dropping them into  Windows Explorer.<br>
That is Windows Explorer the file manager, not Internet Explorer the browser.</p>
<p class="grayfont">In Windows Explorer:<br>
  1. Click on the icon at the left of the path bar to select the current path/address<br>
  2. Type in ftp://theartfulimage.com<br>
  3. Hit the Enter key on the keyboard<br>
  4. You should be prompted for a username and password<br>
  5. After entering the username and password, hit the OK or Logon button<br>
  6. You should now be able to copy and paste, or drag and drop image files to the server
  <br>
  Note: Depending on your connection speed, it may take several minutes for your files to upload.<br>

<h3 class="grayfont">Instructions for uploading images from a computer running Mac OS</h3>
<p class="grayfont">If you are running a Mac, you will need FTP client software if you wish to upload images.</p>
<p class="grayfont">Current recomendations for free Mac FTP clients:<br>
  <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/download.php">FileZilla</a><br>
