<h2 class="pagehead">What is the difference?</h2>
<h3 class="grayfont">What is a giclée print?</h3>
<p class="grayfont"> Giclée printing is an adaption of  high resolution
inkjet technology. The term giclée was first coined  in the early 1990s
and has largely fallen out of use in favor of simpler  descriptive terms
 such as archival pigment ink prints.</p>
<h3 class="grayfont">Why pigment ink prints?</h3>
<p class="grayfont">Using pigment inks on acid and  lignin free cotton,
and other alpha-cellulose based papers, offers the greatest  longevity
of any readily available photographic color printing process. When
mounted under UV protective glass, testing has shown prints can have
expected  longevity of over 200 years. Even when mounted in less ideal
circumstances,  prints should last several decades without visible signs
 of fading or  yellowing.</p>
<p class="grayfont">This type of printing also allows  for the use of
the largest range of media and surfaces: smooth and textured cotton rag
 fine art, etching, and watercolor papers, glossy and semi-glossy photo
papers,  canvas, and translucent materials for back lit photographic
displays. Like  other inkjet technologies, a large range of print sizes
is available: from 4 x  6 inches to 60 inches by 100 feet.<br>
</p>
<p class="grayfont">The color gamut (range of hues  that can be
accurately reproduced) is wide, meaning that there is less chance  of a
color captured by the camera resulting in a color shift on the final
print. Using fully  calibrated display devices at one end and
finely-tuned paper profiles at the  other, allows the creation of prints
 that are very consistent – a print made  one day will look almost
identical to one made of the same image on another  day, even months or
years later.<br>
</p>
<p class="grayfont">Are there any disadvantages? Apart  from the high
costs of the ink and fine papers, there are two possible  disadvantages
on some glossy and semi-glossy paper (lustre, satin, pearl, and  photo
matte). Gloss differential can occur to varying degrees. Gloss
differential is the difference in the apparent sheen of areas where ink
is laid  down and areas the white areas of an image where no ink is
printed. The other potential  minor problem is bronzing: the appearance
of a slight copper or bronze in black  inked areas when viewed from
certain acute angles.<br>
</p>
<h3 class="grayfont">Other types of print<br>
</h3>
<p class="grayfont"><span class="graybold">Lightjet prints</span>
probably come  closest, in terms of quality and resolution,  to archival
 inkjet printing. The process uses laser light to  expose photographic
paper, which is then developed using the standard Kodak  RA-4 wet
chemical process. Some photographers prefer the look of prints made
this way, because the photographic dyes are embedded in the layers of
the  surface, which can give a more three-dimensional appearance. <br>
</p>
<p class="grayfont">Lightjet prints have about one  quarter of the
longevity of pigmented inkjet prints, a smaller color gamut,  can’t
quite create as deep a black, and the range of types of paper available
 is extremely limited.<br>
</p>
<p class="grayfont">Most <span class="graybold">consumer grade inkjet  printers</span>
 use dye based ink and have a limited number ink colors. The least
expensive dye based inkjets often have only cyan, magenta, yellow, and
black  (CMYK). Most come with two blacks; a mat black for text printing
and a glossy  ‘photo’ black. With the correct paper selection they can
produce excellent  prints with an even greater vibrancy and deeper
blacks than pigment inks. There  is also no possibility of gloss
differential or bronzing, because the inks sink  deeply into the paper
coating. There were a small number of papers specially  developed that
increased the longevity of these prints almost to the levels of  those
of pigment inks. Unfortunately, papers with a ‘swellable’ coating have
largely disappeared from the marketplace. Dye ink prints on standard
microporous coated papers are very prone to light damage and can fade
very  quickly.<br>
</p>
<p class="grayfont">The <span class="graybold">C-type prints</span> made
 on the large printing lab machines,  often seen in Walmart and Costco
stores, are good quality prints, and  especially in small sizes such as 5
 x 7 or 4 x 6 inches, can’t be beaten for  price. Like Lightjet
printing, the development is Kodak’s RA-4 wet chemical  process, but
unlike Lightjet, exposure is done using tungsten or LED lighting.  The
resolution isn’t as good and inconsistencies can occur between print
runs. Depending  on freshness of the chemicals and how often the
machines are calibrated, prints  made at one time of day can differ
noticeably from those made at another time.<br>
</p>
<p class="grayfont"><span class="graybold">Dye sublimation prints</span>
 are made  using a ribbon of ink and a heat process on special paper.
Prints made using  this process can be extremely good and have
continuous tones, unlike the  microscopic dots used by inkjet printers.
There are two major disadvantages:  the prints are typically small,
often 4 x 6 inches and only very rarely up to 8 x  12 inches; and there
is no choice of paper surfaces. If you like small prints with  a soft
gloss surface, then dye-sub might be for you.<br>
</p>
<p class="grayfont">Although<span class="graybold"> color laser printers</span>
 produce   faster prints than inkjets, the quality and resolution isn’t
up to that of other  photographic printing solutions. Laser printing is
good for times when ultra  high quality isn’t needed and when volumes up
 to a few hundred sheets are  required. For larger volumes, commercial
offset printing is better both in  terms of speed and cost.<br>
</p>
<p class="grayfont">For black and white printing,  provided you do not
need very large prints, there are several processes that  exceed
archival pigment ink printing in terms of longevity, tonal graduation,
dynamic  range, and resolution.<br>
